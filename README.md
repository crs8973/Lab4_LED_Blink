# Lab4_LED_Blink
This lab was completed by Maya Leighton, Camille Sullivan, and Emily McGee.

In this repository, you can find the circuit diagram for the circuit we created along with the code that allowed the LED on our circuit to blink.

To build the circuit, start by pushing the Argon into the breadboard. Then, at pin D6, push in one end of the LED. Push the other of the LED up 6 rows and right one column. Then, push one end of the resistor in the column to the left adjacent to end of the LED that was just pushed in. Then push the other end of the resistor into the box adjacent to the GND pin (it will reach across the Argon). Connect the Argon to a computer and run the code. The LED on the breadboard should blink (referenced from https://github.com/SUPScientist/Smart-Coasts/tree/main/Class-04-Electronics-101).
